# Description
This project guides the user through a series of choices on which team members the user would like to add to their development team. Based on the user's input, it then generates an HTML file with a responsive card layout including all of the team member's information. Part of the goal of this project was to use the testing package Jest. It is also possible to test out each variable: employee, manager, engineer, and intern using Jest to ensure that they have been created properly. This will greatly help in best understanding the software and potentially opening doors to getting a Quality Assurance position.
